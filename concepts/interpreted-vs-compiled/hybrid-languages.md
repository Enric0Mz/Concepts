# Hybrid Languages

## Overview
Hybrid languages combine features of both compiled and interpreted languages. They typically involve a two-step process where the source code is first compiled into an intermediate representation (like bytecode) and then interpreted or executed by a virtual machine.

## Benefits
- **Portability:** The intermediate code can run on any platform that has the appropriate interpreter or virtual machine, making hybrid languages cross-platform.
- **Performance Optimization:** The compilation step enables optimizations, while interpretation provides flexibility.
- **Ease of Use:** The interpreted nature of the second stage often allows for easier debugging and dynamic features.

## Examples
- **Java:** Compiles code into bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **C#:** Uses the Common Intermediate Language (CIL), executed by the .NET runtime.
- **Python (with JIT):** Although traditionally interpreted, tools like PyPy add Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, making it a hybrid.

## Challenges
- **Performance Overhead:** Hybrid languages can be slower than fully compiled ones due to the interpretation or execution layer.
- **Dependency on Virtual Machines:** The requirement for a virtual machine or runtime environment can add complexity to deployment and execution.
- **Security Risks:** The use of interpreters or virtual machines can expose applications to additional vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
