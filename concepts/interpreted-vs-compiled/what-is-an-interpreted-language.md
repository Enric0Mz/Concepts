# What is an Interpreted Language?

## Overview
An interpreted language relies on an interpreter to execute its source code line by line or statement by statement. Instead of being converted into machine code beforehand, the program is processed at runtime by the interpreter.

## Benefits
- **Ease of Development:** Since interpreted languages do not require compilation, developers can test and debug code more quickly, making them ideal for rapid prototyping.
- **Portability:** Programs can run on any platform that has the appropriate interpreter installed, making cross-platform compatibility more accessible.
- **Flexibility:** Features like dynamic typing and runtime code execution are more commonly found in interpreted languages, enhancing their adaptability.

## Examples
Interpreted languages include early scripting and dynamic languages such as `Python`, `JavaScript`, and `Ruby`. These languages prioritize developer productivity and ease of use over raw performance.

## Challenges
- **Performance:** Programs may run slower compared to compiled languages due to the additional step of interpretation during execution, like `Python` code, for example.
- **Dependency on Interpreter:** Running the program requires the presence of an interpreter, which may introduce versioning or compatibility issues.
